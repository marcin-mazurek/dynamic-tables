## Dynamic Tables prototype

Prototype of React component with multiple 'sticky' columns and header.
To achieve high performance, it uses native JS (changes scrollLeft and scrollTop of header and columns to sync scrolling) rather than state and inline CSS.

Running the project:

```
npm install
npm run dev
open http://localhost:8080
```
